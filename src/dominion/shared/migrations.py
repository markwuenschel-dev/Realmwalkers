"""Lightweight, idempotent column adds for tables that predate a new ORM column.

No Alembic yet (the schema still moves; explicit migrations come when it stabilises). `create_all`
NEVER alters an existing table, so every new *nullable* column added to `models.py` must also be
listed here. Each statement is `ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS`, so applying this is safe on a fresh DB and
on every boot/test alike.

Single source of truth: both the boot provisioner (`scripts/init_db.py`) and the test fixture
(`tests/conftest.py`) call `apply_lightweight_migrations`, so the test schema can't silently drift
from what production runs.
